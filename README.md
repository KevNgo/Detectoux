# Detectoux
Detectoux can detect the covid-19 with a cough. How ? Using Machine Learning, deep learning.. You will have more details with the code in python

For this project, I didn't use deep learning because I created and worked on a dataset which had not a lof of data. There were a lack of data, so it was not relevant to use deep learning. 
However, if I had more data, the detection of covid-19 will be more relevant thanks to the deep learning.
